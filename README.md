# ImageFilters

This program allows the user to apply many common image filters to the given PPM image. This image is given in the SRC file, but could be changed (along with change in makefile) to work with other PPM images. The program currently produces a new copy of the image with each filter.

## Running the Program
Make sure the makefile and the directory are both setup properly. Then, run the program through these commands:
```
make
make run
make clean
```
Note: `make clean` removes the PPM images created and the executable file from the directory
